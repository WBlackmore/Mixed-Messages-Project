# Mixed-Messages-Project

This is a project for the Full Stack Engineer course with Codecademy. 

The objective was to create a program which generates a random string by combining three variables picked at random. 

I have given this program a simple HTML/CSS front end for ease of use. 

It works as so:
  1. User clicks on the 'Genrate Ransom Year button
  2. A random year between 1000BC  - 2022AD is generated as well as an event and a weather type.
  3. The year, event and weather are returned in a string which is placed in a <p> tag on th frontend.
  4. Clicking the button again generates a new randomised set of variables and chaanges the output

  Possible improvements/features:
    1. Add imagery to correspond with results
    2. Improve layout/style
    3. Add more possible outcomes
